I"ﬂ<p>We present a new type of microarchitectural attack that leaks data at
rest: data that is never read into the core architecturally. This
attack technique, Augury, leverages a novel microarchitectural
optimzation present in Apple Silicon: a Data Memory-Dependent
Prefetcher (DMP).</p>

<p>At a high level:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We found that Apple processors have a DMP</li>
  <li>We found that this DMP prefetches an array-of-pointers dereferencing pattern</li>
  <li>We found that you can use this prefetcher to leak data (pointers)
that are never read by any instruction, even speculatively!</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>

<h2 id="what-processors-are-affected">What processors are affected?</h2>

<p>Only Apple silicon processors are affected. We have confirmed the
existence of the DMP on the A14, M1, and M1 Max. We believe some older A-series
processors and the newest M1-family (M1 Pro, etc.) chips are also
affected but have only confirmed this on the M1 Max.</p>

<p>We have tested several recent families of Intel and AMD processors and
seen no evidence they are affected.</p>

<h2 id="how-bad-is-this">How bad is this?</h2>

<p><em>Right now</em> not that bad! We have not demonstrated any end-to-end
exploits with Augury techniques at this time. Currently, only pointers
can be leaked, and likely only in the sandbox threat model.</p>

<p>If you are counting on ASLR in a sandbox, I‚Äôd be worried. Otherwise,
be worried when the next round of attacks using Augury come out :)</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-a-dmp">What exactly is a DMP?</h2>

<p>A Data Memory-Dependent Prefetcher (DMP) is a prefetcher that takes
into account the content of memory when deciding what to prefetch. A
conceptually simple (if tricky to implement) DMP is one that watches
the stream of cache lines returned from the memory system, and
attempts a prefetch on any 64-bit chunk that appears to be a pointer.</p>

<h2 id="what-dmp-structure-did-you-find">What DMP structure did you find?</h2>

<p>In Apple Silicon we found an Array-of-Pointers (AoP) DMP. This
prefetcher looks for access patterns of the following form:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span> <span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">arr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once it has seen <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*arr[0]</code> ‚Ä¶ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*arr[2]</code> occur (even speculatively!)
it will begin prefetching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*arr[3]</code> onward.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-augury-different-from-spectremdsetc">What makes Augury different from Spectre/MDS/etc?</h2>

<p>Augury techniques leverage <em>only</em> the DMP, not transient execution. In
fact, speculative execution could be completely disabled and Augury
would still work.</p>

<p>A more subtle, but important point, is that the types of defenses that
apply to Augury are not the same as other microarchitectural
attacks. Any defense that relies on tracking what data is accessed by
the core (speculatively or non-speculatively) cannot protect against
Augury, as the leaked data is never read by the core!</p>

<p>Some Spectre defenses (notably defenses like Site Isolation) also
apply to Augury attacks since they have a similar effective
reach. Other defenses like Speculative Load Hardening are not
applicable and will not prevent Augury for leaking data.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-data-at-rest-attack">What is a ‚Äúdata at rest‚Äù attack?</h2>

<p>Data at rest microarchitectural leakage is a type of attack where the
targeted data is never read into the core speculatively or
non-speculatively, and yet is leaked. We described the likely
existence of these attacks in
<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~dkohlbre/papers/pandora_isca2021.pdf">Pandora</a>. but
had not found any examples until now.</p>

<p>These attacks are problematic because most defensive approaches in
hardware or software for other microarchitectural attacks assume there
is some instruction that accesses the secret. They can then either
stop this access from occurring, or prevent the transmission of the
secret. Data at rest attacks do not have this property, and must be
mitigated differently.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-find-this">How did you find this?</h2>

<p>We had been looking for DMP implementations in the wild for some time,
and previously discussed the dangers they present in
<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~dkohlbre/papers/pandora_isca2021.pdf">Pandora</a>.</p>

<p>We began looking at the M1 and A14 after reading this
<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16226/apple-silicon-m1-a14-deep-dive/3">Anandtech</a>
article including the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our microarchitectural investigations we‚Äôve seen signs of ‚Äúmemory
magic‚Äù on Apple‚Äôs designs, where we might believe they‚Äôre using some
sort of pointer-chase prefetching mechanism.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="why-augury">Why ‚ÄúAugury‚Äù?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúthe work of an augur; the interpretation of omens.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Augury is a neat word to say.</p>

<p>More seriously, it well describes the process of leaking information
using a DMP. We are, in fact, interpreting the ‚Äòsigns of the future‚Äô
that the DMP has left in microarchitectural state for us. It turns out
that those futures weren‚Äôt going to happen, but we still learn
something from them!</p>

<p>Plus, no one had taken it :)</p>

<h2 id="is-apple-patching-anything">Is Apple patching anything?</h2>

<p>As far as we know, no.
We have discussed this issue with Apple and they are aware of all details.</p>
